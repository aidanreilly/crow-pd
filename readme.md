*WORK IN PROGRESS*

crow.pd requires the following libraries/externals (use deken to install):

* zexy
* cyclone
* ofelia

to use zexy, you  must declare the zexy library in startup preferences (startup flags `-lib zexy`). zexy, ofelia and cyclone should be added to search path. 

tested on windows 10, Pd version 0.50.0.
